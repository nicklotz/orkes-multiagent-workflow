    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Three specialized AI agents (Classifier, Knowledge, Escalation) working together\n",
    "2. **Custom Worker Integration**: A worker task that polls Conductor and executes external business logic\n",
    "3. **Workflow Composition**: Using Conductor's SDK to build complex workflows with conditional logic\n",
    "4. **Monitoring & Observability**: Built-in capabilities to track workflow execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Workers can be scaled independently based on load\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Conductor handles retries, error handling, and task persistence\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new agents or modify the workflow without changing agent code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integrate with your actual LLM provider and knowledge base\n",
    "2. Add error handling and retry policies\n",
    "3. Implement real notification channels (Slack, Email, PagerDuty)\n",
    "4. Set up monitoring and alerting\n",
    "5. Deploy workers as containerized services\n"
